# Database Configuration

Taskcluster uses a Postgres 11 database for its backend storage.
A single database is shared among all services.

Taskcluster assumes that it "owns" the database, but can share a single server with other users.
For production purposes we recommend a dedicated server, due to the possibility of contention for server resources, but sharing a server acceptable for non-production environments.

## DB Users

Each service uses its own Postgres user to access the database, and Taskcluster uses this functionality internally to isolate services from one another.
The Taskcluster deployment process additionally requires an "admin" user that is used for schema migrations and to update the permissions of the per-service users.
This admin user must have full permission to all resources in the selected database, as well as permission to grant and revoke access for the service users.

The admin user can have any name.
Because users are global to a Postgres server, Taskcluster requires a name prefix which is applied to each per-service user.
In a non-production environment, this allows several installations of Taskcluster to co-exist on the same server.
We recommend that the admin username and the prefix be the same string.

The set of users that must be configured, then, are:

TODO: generate this list automatically from db/access.yml

 * `<prefix>` -- admin user
 * `<prefix>_taskcluster_queue` -- user for the queue service
 * ...

Set these up using something with the following effect:

```
CREATE USER <prefix> PASSWORD '<admin_password>';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE <dbname> TO <prefix> WITH GRANT OPTION;
CREATE USER <prefix>_taskcluster_queue PASSWORD '<queue_password>';
...
```

## Read and Write Replicas

Taskcluster assumes full transactional consistency from Postgres.
That is, once a transaction is committed, the results of that transaction must be visible everywhere.
Furthermore, Taskcluster relies on per-row locks to perform queueing operations.
Within these parameters, the backend database can be replicated and sharded as load and availability demand.

Taskcluster allows each service to be configured with both "read-only" and "read-write" access configuration.
The read-only configuration will only be used to read from the database.
This can be used to direct reads to read-only replicas, in cases where the read load is significantly higher than the write load.
However, note that these read-only replicas must conform to the consistency requirements described above.

## Configuration

Database access is configured with URL-shaped strings as defined by [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting).

Each service that requires database access has Helm properties `<service>.readDbUrl` and `<service>.writeDbUrl`.
Set these values to include the corresponding database users' credentials.
In a non-replicated scenario, set each service's read and write URLs to the same value.
For example:

```yaml
queue:
  readDbUrl: postgresql://prod_taskcluster_queue:sekrit@readonly.tc-db.example.com/taskcluster_prod
  writeDbUrl: postgresql://prod_taskcluster_queue:sekrit@readwrite.tc-db.example.com/taskcluster_prod
```

<Warning>
Note that the admin user's credentials should not appear anywhere in the Helm configuration!
