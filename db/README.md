# Taskcluster Database

This directory defines the Taskcluster database:

* `versions/` -- the migrations that create the most-recent database schema
* `test/` -- tests for the contents of this directory
* `src/` -- implementation of the JS interface to the DB

## Stored Procedures

<!-- SP BEGIN -->
### secrets

| Name | Mode | Arguments | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| get_secret | read | name text | table (secret text) | Get the single secret associated with a given secret name, or an empty result if no such secret exists. |
| get_secret_with_expires | read | name text | table (secret text, expires timestamp) | Get the single secret associated with a given secret name, or an empty result if no such secret exists.<br />Note that this may include rows with an expiration in the past, as rows are only deleted occasionally. |
| list_secrets | read |  | table (name text) | List the names of all secrets. |
| list_secrets_with_expires | read |  | table (name text, expires timestamp) | List the names and expiration dates of all secrets.<br />Note that this may include rows with an expiration in the past, as rows are only deleted occasionally. |
| remove_secret | write | name text | void | Delete the secret associated with the given name. |
| remove_secret | write | name text | void | Delete the secret associated with some key. |
| set_secret | write | name text, secret text | void | Set the secret associated with the given name.<br />If the secret already exists, it is updated instead. |
| set_secret_with_expires | write | name text, secret text, expires timestamp | void | Set the secret associated with the given name.<br />If the secret already exists, it is updated instead. |

## Database Schema

TBD

### Versions

TBD

## JS Interface

The `taskcluster-db` package exports an async `setup` function which is intended to be used in services' `main.js`:

```javascript
const tcdb = require('taskcluster-db');
// ...
  db: {
    requires: ['cfg'],
    setup: ({cfg}) => tcdb.setup({
      readDbUrl: cfg.db.readDbUrl,
      writeDbUrl: cfg.db.writeDbUrl,
      serviceName: 'queue',
    }),
  }
```

The result is a taskcluster-lib-postgres Database instance all set up and ready to use.
This uses the generated schema by default.

Similarly, the `upgrade` method will upgrade a database to the current version.
To upgrade to a specific version, pass `toVersion: <number>`.
This functionality is typically used in tests, as in production deployments the deployers will run `yarn db:upgrade`.

```javascript
const tcdb = require('taskcluster-db');

setup('upgrade db', async function() {
  await tcdb.upgrade({adminDbUrl: process.env.TEST_DB_URL});
});
```

Both of these functions take an optional `useDbDirectory: true` to indicate that they should read from the YAML files under `db/` instead of using the serialized format.
This approach is slower, but is appropriate for testing.

### Testing Support

For testing purposes, this package provides a completely *fake* `db` instance, implemented entirely in JS.
This means that services can be tested without access to a postgres database.

The fake database is available via

```javascript
const tcdb = require('taskcluster-db');
const fakeDb = tcdb.fakeSetup({serviceName: 'queue'});
```

All of the `fakeDb.proc.<name>` methods to which the service has access are available.
Specific helper methods are available on sub-objects, such as `fakeDb.secrets.makeSecret`.
See the source code of this package for the specific helpers that are available.

## Development

To test this library, you will need a Postgres database, running the latest release of Postgres 11.
The easiest and best way to do this is to use docker:

```shell
docker run -ti -p 5432:5432  --rm postgres:11
```

This will run Docker in the foreground in that terminal (so you'll need to use another terminal for your work, or add the `-d` flag to daemonize the container) and make that available on TCP port 5432, the "normal" postgres port.
An advantage of running in the foreground is that Postgres helpfully logs every query that it runs, which can help with debugging and testing.

*NOTE* the test siute repeatedly drops the `public` schema and re-creates it, effectively deleting all data in the database.
Do not run these tests against a database instance that contains any useful data!

Once this container is running, set TEST_DB_URL to point to the database, as defined by [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting).
For the docker container described above, use

```shell
export TEST_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres@localhost/postgres
```
